Clutch
===========

Keybindings for vehicles in World of Warcraft.


Why?
-----------

I have most of my spells keybound directly so they are consistent between my
two specs, sans the few that do change between my specs. This means most of
my action bar is actually not bound--so I had to click my spells when doing the
Argent Tournament jousting quests. This infuriated me, so Clutch was born to
alleviate that mess.


Status
-----------

Clutch is definitely in alpha. It currently works for my needs, but I am going
to work on providing a user interface for others and adding per-vehicle
keybindings.


Problems
-----------

You cannot change keybindings while InCombat(), so I have to find a way to
work around this as best as I can so the users are aware of the situation.


Contact

The webpage and contact info will go up once there is a 1.0 (with full UI)
build of Clutch.
